# Binary-Classificatiion

Problem Statement :- 
In this section we are implementing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier for classifying Cat and Dog.

Datasets :- 
The dataset provided consists of training data and testing data for both the categories.

Dependencies :- 
Jupyter Notebook
Tensorflow
Python 3.6
Numpy

Solutions :- 
The algorithm was trained on well classified and labelled image data consisting of 10,000 images.
The accuracy obtained was around 82-83%.
This code realizes a CNN for binary classification using tensorflow backened keras.
